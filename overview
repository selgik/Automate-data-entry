  1. CASE STUDY: 
      You are working in a QA project as reviewer. You are reviewing contents* that has an unique reference ID**. 
      If you notice an error in the content, you track its reference ID, categorize errors and leave comments in the spreadsheet.
      Once target amounts of errors are captured, you clean the spreadsheet and repeat the process next day.
     
      * Contents here, mean any type of texst, photo, audio or video files. 
      ** An example of Reference ID is 14##AB34aood.
      
  2. SCHEMA:
      (1) Worksheet:
          WORKSHEET NAME            DESCRIPTION 
          a. entry_form_worksheet   Source worksheet where entry_form resides.    
          b. tracker_worksheet      Target worksheet where tracker table resides.
      
      (2-1) Table: entry_form_worksheet.entry_form
          FIELD/RECORD NAME         TYPE            MODE            DESCRIPTION
          a. Reference ID#          STRING          Required        Web link, file address or content reference number that needed to be tracked.
          b. Error                  STRING          Required        Error type selectable from the list (data validation inserted).
          c. Comment                STRING          Nullable        Comments section with/without characters limitation.
          
      (2-2) Table: tracker_worksheet.tracker
          FIELD NAME                TYPE            MODE            DESCRIPTION
          a. Date                   Date            Required        Display today's date via =TODAY()
          b. Name                   STRING          Required        Reviewer's name. 
          c. Core ID#               STRING          Required        Substring of 2.(2-1)a, manipulated via LEFT,RIGHT or MID.
          d. Error                  STRING          Required        2.(2-1)b
          e. Error group            STRING          Required        Hirarchial value of 2.(2-1)b, pulled out via VLOOKUP 
          f. Error type             STRING          Required        Hirarchial value of 2.(2-1)b, pulled out via VLOOKUP  
          g. Comment                STRING          Nullable        2.(2-1)c
     
  3. WORKFLOW:
       You notice an error in the content. 
         -> You need to track 2.(2-1) data. 
         -> You enter 2.(2-1) data into macro-enabled data entry form. 
         -> Now 2.(2-1) data sits under the 2.(1)a
         -> You click insert button built within the macro-enabled data entry form.
             -> Macro will trigger 2.(2-1) data to be transffered from 2.(1)a to 2.1(b).
             -> By transffering, macro will feed 2.(2-1) data to 2.(2-2) table.
                 -> Next set of 2.(2-1) data will add record (to the next line of the row). 
      
  4. DELIVABLES:
      Depending on the scenario, two types of macro-enabled excel spreadsheet can be created.
      
      (1) Type: If the content you are reviewing would generally contain 1-3 types of errors, track errors per error type. 
                Scenario  : You need to track two types of error, type A and B for content 14##AB34aood.
                Use guide : You track error type A and use Insert_Button(). Repeat the process to track the error type B. 
                Results   : You will have two records generated in 2.(1)b, for error type A and B.
      (2) Type: If the content you are reviewing would generally contain 3+ types of errors, track errors per content. 
                Scenario  : You need to track 4 types of error, type A, B, C and D.
                Use guide : You track error type A, B, C, D and use Insert_Button().
                Results   : You will have four records generated in 2.(2)b, for type A, B, C and D.
