  1. DESCRIPTION: 
      You are working in a QA project as a reviewer. You are checking contents* that has an unique reference ID**. 
      If you notice an error in the content, you track its reference ID, categorize errors and leave comments in the spreadsheet.
      If you do not notice any error in the content, you do not have to track anything in the spreadsheet.
      Once target amounts of errors are captured, you clean the spreadsheet and repeat the process next day.
     
      * Contents reference any type of texst, photo, audio or video files. 
      ** An example of Reference ID is 14##AB34aood. 

  2. WORKFLOW:
     (1) You notice an error in the content. 
         You need to track reference ID, error types and comments for the content ("error data"). 
         --> (2) You enter error data into macro-enabled data entry form ("entry_form"). 
                 Currently error data sits under the spreadsheet ("entry_form_worksheet") containing entry_form. 
                 You click insert button of the entry_form.
                 --> (3) entry_form will trigger error data to be transffered from entry_form_worksheet to
                         the linked worksheet ("tracker_worksheet") containing tracking table ("tracker_table").
                         By transffering, macro will feed error data to targeted cells in the tracker_table.
                         Once transffered, macro will erase the entered data from the entry_form.
                         --> (4) Error types will be counted and highlighted with color once erorr types hits targeted number.
                                 --> (5) Next set of error data will add record (to the next line of the row). 
                                         Process (1)-(4) will be repeated. 
                 
  3. SCHEMA:

  4. DELIVABLES:
      Depending on the scenario, two types of macro-enabled excel spreadsheet can be created.
      
      (1) Type: If the content you are reviewing would generally contain 1-3 types of errors, track errors per error type. 
                Scenario  : You need to track two types of error, type A and B for content 14##AB34aood.
                Use guide : You track error type A and use Insert_Button(). Repeat the process to track the error type B. 
                Results   : You will have two records generated in 2.(1)b, for error type A and B.
      (2) Type: If the content you are reviewing would generally contain 3+ types of errors, track errors per content. 
                Scenario  : You need to track 4 types of error, type A, B, C and D.
                Use guide : You track error type A, B, C, D and use Insert_Button().
                Results   : You will have four records generated in 2.(1)b, for type A, B, C and D.
