  1. MOTIVATION
     (1) Task:
         I need to spend certain amount of time (for example: at least 5.5h) to assigned project on daily basis. 
         Although I can work flexibly, as working on project 8h one day and 2h on another day, 
         it is recommended to meet average goal of mentioned 5.5h. 
         
     (2) Problem:
         a. I need to manually calculate the project time to meet daily, weekly and monthly goal. 
         b. I work hard everyday but I cannot meet the assigned goal. I do not know how can I improve.
            (ex. if I am not meeting 5.5h goal, where am I spending time? where can I improve?) 
            
     (3) Motivation:
         a. I want to be free from calculating remaining hours to meet weekly/monthly average goal. 
         b. I want analyze my time and see the area of improvement. 
            I want to know where am I spending rest of my time and where can I reduce to meet targeted project hour.
         c. A dashboard solving problem a and b, could be helpful.
         
  2. PROCESS DESIGN
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Overall workflow: 
         User enters data via the form in sheet_1 -> 
              Data is transffered to sheet_2, new data to be piled up in the next row -> 
                  Data is re-transffered to sheet_3 undergoing cleaning, calculation, pivoting process -> 
                      Cleaned data is represented in the graphs and bulletin in the sheet_1.                      
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       
     (1) Step 1 - layout design
         I want to have one-page dashboard:
         a. 1st component will be the form, user will be updating last working day's project hour.
         b. 2nd component will be the bulletin where remaining hour for given week is calculated.
         c. 3rd component will be a chart showing progress against the goal for the last working day.
         d. 4th component will be a chart showing daily progress (time spent on project hour).
         e. 5th component will be a chart analyzing activies on reamining hours.
         f. 6th component will be a table showing monthly summary.
         
         I want to have 3 spreadsheet:
         g. sheet_1: main dashboard sheet containing form, bulletin, charts and table.
         h. sheet_2: raw data sheet where fed data from the form will be organized.
         i. sheet_3: calculation sheet where pivot tables and other calculations will be performed.
         
     (2) Step 2 - enter data (ref: 2(1)a)
         a. What do I want to do? I want:
         - User to feed (select or type) date, day type (full day/half day) and project hour.
         - User to optionally feed activity hour to analyze how remaining hours are used.
         - Fed data to be organized in table in a spearate sheet.
         b. How?
         - Solution: use VBA. Create button which will trigger the data transfer process.
         - Flow: user feeds data to the form in sheet_1 -> button -> data is transffered and organized within the table in sheet_2. 
         
     (3) Step 3 - process data
         a. Create pivot tables
         - Charts will be created based on the pivot tables. For each type of chart, independent pivot table will need to be created.
         - All calculations, pivot tables and data validation lists etc. will be organized in this sheet_3. 
         b. Hide the sheet
         - To avoid confusion and breaking the format, all sheets will be protected except where user is feeding data in the form.
         - Additinoally, this sheet_3 will be hidden as users do not need to see background data (table, pivot, reference list etc.)
         
     (4) Step 4 - data visualization
         a. Decide optimal chart type
         - 2(1)c: donut chart
         - 2(1)d: bar or line chart
         - 2(1)e: donut chart combining with horizontal bar chart showing top ranks in remaining hour section. 
    
     (5) Step 5 - test
         a. Test out various chart types and color to see the overall harmony.
         b. Ask questions
         - Did I put too much information? Sould I reduce charts? Did I select too many chart types?
         - Will the form be placed on the left or right? Which one is more user friendly? 
         
         
  3. BUILDING SCHEMA
     (1) Worksheet:
         Worksheet Name         Description
         a. sheet_1             main dashboard sheet containing form, bulletin, charts and table.
         b. sheet_2             raw data sheet where fed data from the form will be organized.
         c. sheet_3             calculation sheet where pivot tables and other calculations will be performed.

     (2) Table (sheet_1):
         Field Name             Description
         a. Working hour        Add data validation. Select from the list: full or half day.
         b. Date                Add data validation. Select from the list: list of last "n" date. 
         c. Project hour        User can type in the form of hour or minute.
         d. Other activity(s)   User can type in the form of hour or minute.
         e. Comment             User can type strings.
         + Button               User can click. Link VBA code to transffered entered data from sheet_1 to sheet_2.
      
     (3) Table (sheet_3):
         Pivot tables to be created from data source sheet_2.
