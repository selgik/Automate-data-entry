  1. MOTIVATION
     (1) Task:
         I need to spend certain amount of time (for example: at least 5.5h) to assigned project on daily basis. 
         Although I can work flexibly, as working on project 8h one day and 2h on another day, 
         it is recommended to meet average goal of mentioned 5.5h. 
         
     (2) Problem:
         a. I need to manually calculate the project time to meet daily, weekly and monthly goal. 
         b. I work hard everyday but I cannot meet the assigned goal. I do not know how can I improve.
            (ex. if I am not meeting 5.5h goal, where am I spending time? where can I improve?) 
            
     (3) Motivation:
         a. I want to be free from calculating remaining hours to meet weekly/monthly average goal. 
         b. I want analyze my time and see the area of improvement. 
            I want to know where am I spending rest of my time and where can I reduce to meet targeted project hour.
         c. A dashboard solving problem a and b, could be helpful.
         
  2. PROCESS DESIGN
     (1) Step 1 - layout design
         I want to have one-page dashboard:
         a. 1st component will be the form, user will be updating last working day's project hour.
         b. 2nd component will be the bulletin where remaining hour for given week is calculated.
         c. 3rd component will be a chart showing progress against the goal for the last working day.
         d. 4th component will be a chart showing daily progress (time spent on project hour).
         e. 5th component will be a chart analyzing activies on reamining hours.
         f. 6th component will be a table showing monthly summary.
           
     (2) Step 2 - data entry (ref: 2(1)a.)
         a. What do I want to do? I want...
         - User to feed data (select or type) on date, day type (full day/half day) and project hour.
         - User to optionally feed activity hour to analyze how remaining hours are used.
         b. How?
         - solution: use VBA. Create one spreadsheet containing form, another spreadsheet containing fed data.
         - flow: user feed data in the form -> VBA -> data is organized within the table in another sheet. 
        
         
     (3) Step 3 - data transfer
     (4) Step 4 - data visualization
     (5) Step 5 - test
