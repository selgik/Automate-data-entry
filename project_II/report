  1. MOTIVATION
     (1) Task:
         I need to spend certain amount of time (for example: at least 5.5h) to assigned project on daily basis. 
         Although I can work flexibly, as working on project 8h one day and 2h on another day, 
         it is recommended to meet average goal of mentioned 5.5h. 
         
     (2) Problem:
         a. I need to manually calculate the project time to meet daily, weekly and monthly goal. 
         b. I work hard everyday but I cannot meet the assigned goal. I do not know how can I improve.
            (ex. if I am not meeting 5.5h goal, where am I spending time? where can I improve?) 
            
     (3) Motivation:
         a. I want to be free from calculating remaining hours to meet weekly/monthly average goal. 
         b. I want analyze my time and see the area of improvement. 
            I want to know where am I spending rest of my time and where can I reduce to meet targeted project hour.
         c. A dashboard solving problem a and b, could be helpful.
