  1. MOTIVATION
      You are working in a QA project as a reviewer. You are checking contents* that has an unique reference ID**.
      If you notice an error in the content, you track its reference ID, categorize errors and leave comments in the spreadsheet.
      
      a. The problem is, current spreadsheet forces me to choose 3 types of hirarchiar errors manually.
         Also, I need to copy and paste the reference ID somewhere else and just track the track the certain part of it.
         Due to its manual and repetitive nature, I waste time and make mistakes.
  
      b. Once target amounts of errors are captured, you clean the spreadsheet and repeat the process next day.
         The difficulty is, I need to manually count the various types of error and I sometimes lose the track of it.
         Also, I need to copy and paste the table template every day. Otherwise, I drag the table and clear contents manually.
      
      I want to automate manual and repetitive process to reduce time and errors.
     
      * Contents refer to any type of texst, photo, audio or video files. 
      ** An example of Reference ID can be "https://sample.address.com/sample1/error123/phototype121" or "14##AB34aood". 

  2. PREPARATION:
     (1) You notice an error in the content. 
         You need to track reference ID, error types and comments for the content ("error data"). 
         --> (2) You enter error data into macro-enabled data entry form ("entry_form"). 
                 Currently error data sits under the spreadsheet1 ("entry_form_worksheet") containing entry_form. 
                 You click insert button built in the entry_form. 
                 --> (3) Clicking insert button will trigger error data to be transffered from entry_form_worksheet to the linked worksheet2 ("tracker_worksheet"). 
                         Tracker_worksheet contains tracking table ("tracker_table").
                         By transffering, macro will feed error data to targeted cells in the tracker_table.
                         Once transffered, macro will erase the entered data from the entry_form.
                         --> (4) Upon the transfer, error types will be counted in the table ("count_table") next to the entry_form in entry_form_worksheet.
                                 counter_table use COUNTIF range from tracker_table. 
                                 Once the erorr types hit targeted number, error types cell and/or row will be highlighted. 
                                 Reviewer can stop tracking highlighted error type. 
                                 --> (5) Next set of error data will trigger adding next record (to the next line of the row) in the tracker_table. 
                                         Process (1)-(4) will be repeated. 
                 
  3. SCHEMA:

4. DELIVABLES:
      Depending on the scenario, two types of macro-enabled excel spreadsheet can be created.
      
      (1) Type: If the content you are reviewing would generally contain 1-3 types of errors, track errors per error type. 
                Scenario  : You need to track two types of error, type A and B for content 14##AB34aood.
                Use guide : You track error type A and use Insert_Button(). Repeat the process to track the error type B. 
                Results   : You will have two records generated in 2.(1)b, for error type A and B.
      (2) Type: If the content you are reviewing would generally contain 3+ types of errors, track errors per content. 
                Scenario  : You need to track 4 types of error, type A, B, C and D.
                Use guide : You track error type A, B, C, D and use Insert_Button().
                Results   : You will have four records generated in 2.(1)b, for type A, B, C and D.
