-----------------------------------------------------

  1. WHY SHOULD I AUTOMATE A DATA ENTRY PROCESS? 
     (1) Task:
         I am working in a QA project as a reviewer. I am checking contents* that has an unique reference ID**.
         If I notice an error in the content, I track its reference ID, categorize errors and leave comments in the spreadsheet.
         Once target amounts of errors are captured, I clean the spreadsheet and repeat the process next day.

     (2) Problem:
         a. I need to choose 3 types of hirarchiar errors from the list manually.
         b. I need to copy and paste the reference ID somewhere else and just track the certain part of it.
         c. I need to manually count the various types of error and I easily lose a track of it.
         d. I need to copy and paste the table template every day. Or, I drag the table and clear contents manually.

     (3) Motivation:
         I want to automate manual and repetitive process to reduce time and errors.
         I anticipate the macro-enabled spreadsheet will at least reduce 50% of steps invovled in the tracking process.
 
         * Contents refer to any type of texst, photo, audio or video files. 
         ** An example of reference ID can be "https://sample.address.com/sample1/error123/phototype121" or "14##AB34aood". 


  2. WHAT DO I WANT TO AUTOMATE?
     (1) I notice an error in the content. 
         I need to track reference ID, error types and comments for the content ("error data"). 
         --> (2) I enter error data into macro-enabled data entry form ("entry_form"). 
                 Currently error data sits under the spreadsheet1 ("entry_form_worksheet") containing entry_form. 
                 I click insert button built in the entry_form. 
                 --> (3) Clicking insert button will trigger error data to be transffered from entry_form_worksheet to the linked worksheet2 ("tracker_worksheet"). 
                         Tracker_worksheet contains tracking table ("tracker_table").
                         By transffering, macro will feed error data to targeted cells in the tracker_table.
                         Once transffered, macro will erase the entered data from the entry_form.
                         --> (4) Upon the transfer, error types will be counted in the table ("count_table") next to the entry_form in entry_form_worksheet.
                                 counter_table use COUNTIF range from tracker_table. 
                                 Once the erorr types hit targeted number, error types cell and/or row will be highlighted. 
                                 Reviewer can stop tracking highlighted error type. 
                                 --> (5) Next set of error data will trigger adding next record (to the next line of the row) in the tracker_table. 
                                         Process (1)-(4) will be repeated. 
                 
  3. HOW DOES THE SCHEMA LOOK LIKE?
      (1) Worksheet:

4. HOW DOES THE FINAL DELIVABLES LOOK LIKE?
      Depending on the scenario, two types of macro-enabled excel spreadsheet can be created.
      
      (1) Type: If the content you are reviewing would generally contain 1-3 types of errors, track errors per error type. 
                Scenario  : You need to track two types of error, type A and B for content 14##AB34aood.
                Use guide : You track error type A and use Insert_Button(). Repeat the process to track the error type B. 
                Results   : You will have two records generated in 2.(1)b, for error type A and B.
      (2) Type: If the content you are reviewing would generally contain 3+ types of errors, track errors per content. 
                Scenario  : You need to track 4 types of error, type A, B, C and D.
                Use guide : You track error type A, B, C, D and use Insert_Button().
                Results   : You will have four records generated in 2.(1)b, for type A, B, C and D.
