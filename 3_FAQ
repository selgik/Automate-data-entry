PROBLEMATIC SCENARIO AND FAQ
------------------------------------------------

1. QUESTION: 
    When using 3(2) Type macro, how do I ensure that comment matches with certain type of error?
    Example: I need to track error type A, B, C and D. For error type A, my comment is "apple". 
             For error type B "orange", for type C "coconut" and for type D "melon". 
             In the Tracker worksheet I want 4 rows to be generated separately per error type matched with its comments. 
             
2. ANSWER: 
    Follow the error type order when adding comments.
    Example: When choosing the error types you followed the order of error type A, B, C and D.
             Then you follow the same order when entering comments by adding "apple", "organe", "coconut" and "melon".
