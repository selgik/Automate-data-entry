OBJECTIVE: REDUCE MANUAL ENTRY IN EXCEL VIA MACRO
--------------------------------------------------

  1. Background: 
      You are working in a QA project. You are reviewing contents that has an unique reference number. 
      If you notice an error, you track its reference number, categorize errors and leave comments in the spreadsheet.
      Once certain amounts of errors are captured, you clean the spreadsheet and repeat the process next day.
      
      Necessary information that need to be tracked in this project includes:
      (1) An extract of strings (ex. web link, file address, contents reference numbers etc.) 
      (2) Nominal values organized by hirarchy (ex. The error group, error type, error sub type etc.)
      (3) Strings (ex. comments)
        
  2. WORKFLOW: 
      (1) In the Entry_Form worksheet, you copy the whole 1(1). Form will transfer extract in the linked table.
      (2) In the Entry_Form worksheet, you select error type from the list and add comment.
      (3) You click Insert_Button() and entered data will be transffered to assigned cells in the Tracker worksheet.
      (4) You click Clear button() in Tracker worksheet which alert you before clearing contents in the defined cells.
      
  3. SOLUTION:
      Depending on the scenario, two types of macro-enabled excel file can be created.
      (1) Type: If one content would generally have 1-3 types of errors, track error per type. 
                Example: You need to track two types of error, type A and B. 
                You track error type A and user Insert_Button() and repeat process for tracking error type B. 
      (2) Type: if one content would generally have 3+ types of errors, track error per content. 
                Example: You need to track 4 types of error, type A,B,C and D.
                You track error type A, B, C, D and user Insert_Button().
