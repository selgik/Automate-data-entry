IMPORTANT NOTE FOR FUNCTIONS, FORMULAS AND VBA 
------------------------------------------------

FUNCTIONS AND FORMULAS USED

1. Extract certain part within string you enter in the Entry_Form worksheet. 
    =MID (RIGHT(A1,LEN(A1)-FIND("keyword",A1)),#,##)
    
    (1) Formula : MID("text", start number, number of characters)
                  Example: MID("apple", 2, 2) is pp.
    (2) A1      : Once full reference number is entered in Entry_Form worksheet it will be transffered to A1 in Tracker worksheet. 
                  This formula can be written in A2 while A1 is hidden, as we only need certain part of A1.
    (3) keyword : Enter keyword you want the extract to start. 
                  Example: Reference ID of content has repeated patterns starting with UID. Say, 123e5##UID99ab00s.
                  And the part you need is UID99ab00s. "UID" will be your keyword.
    (4) #       : Start number
    (5) ##      : Number of characters

2. To auto-populate corresponding error group/sub-group: 
    =VLOOKUP(TargetCell,ReferenceTableToSearh,2,FALSE)
3. To track the number of errors:
    =COUNTIF(range,criteria)
4. To highlight cell(s) and rows once certain amounts of errors are tracked: 
    Conditional formatting > New rule > Style: Classic > Use a formula to determine which cells to format

VBA USED

1. Cells(x, y) indicates Cells(row#, column#). 
    Ex: row 3 coulmn C = Cells(3, 3) 
2. VBA to stop macro when/if cell is empty: 
    If ActiveSheet.Range("A1").Value = "" Then Exit Sub 
3. Tips:
    To add certain VBA as sub query, simply add code name without () 
    Put the sub code in the right position, otherwise it won't work as expected.

Q&A
------------------------------------------------

1. QUESTION: 
    When using 3(2) Type macro, how do I ensure that comment matches with certain type of error?
    Example: I need to track error type A, B, C and D. For error type A, my comment is "apple". 
             For error type B "orange", for type C "coconut" and for type D "melon". 
             In the Tracker worksheet I want 4 rows to be generated separately per error type matched with its comments. 
             
   ANSWER: 
    Follow the error type order when adding comments.
    Example: When choosing the error types you followed the order of error type A, B, C and D.
             Then you follow the same order when entering comments by adding "apple", "organe", "coconut" and "melon".
